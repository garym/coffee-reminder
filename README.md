# coffee-reminder
A micro:bit radio communication based office coffee machine reminding system

## The problem
The office coffee machine needs cleaning but it is easy to forget as you are leaving after a hard day of work.
Perhaps what you need is a device near the door to remind you!

## Functions:

Holding both A and B sets the alert state.
Button A or Button B sends a reset.

The alert currently should go off 8 hours after a reset, showing the same display as for holding down both A and B.

## Installation

At the moment I just make use of https://codewith.mu/ to upload the code to the board.
If anyone wants me to work out better instructions or wants to contribute better instructions, please let me know.
